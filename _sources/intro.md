# Time Series Econometrics Assignments

This book is for my class in Time Series Econometrics (EBGN594) at the Colorado School of Mines. The intention of this book is to display the work I've completed, demonstrate my understanding of these topics, and to hopefully serve as an educational resource to people in the future. Note that I am/was a student of this course, so there are likely many errors in my analysis and code. Please enjoy and feedback is always appreciated!
